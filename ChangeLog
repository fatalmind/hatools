V2.13/04-Dec-2009:
   * An environment manipulation problem in hatimerun and halockrun was 
     fixed.
     The environment variable POSIXLY_CORRECT is set by hatools to allow
     proper command line parsing. The environment was not reverted before
     the protected command was started and might have caused improper
     command line parsing in the executed command.
     The fix makes sure the environment is reverted to it's original
     state before the actual command is started.
     Again, Thx to Vallo Kallaste for the report and the retest.

V2.12/30-Nov-2009:
   * A build problem was fixed. Thx. to Vallo Kallaste for the report and 
     the retest.
     The bug has prevented successful compilation on some systems. If you 
     did not suffer any build problems, there is no need to upgrade.

V2.11/09-Nov-2009:
   * halockrun: fixed a bug in asynchronous mode (-a). Which was
                introduced with the previous version.
		Due to this bug, the lock was not acquired when using the -a flag.
   * halockrun: improved error handling for async mode (-a) so that
                the alternative error code (-E) works correctly.

V2.10/04-May-2009:
   * halockrun: fixed a bug in non-blocking mode for systems
                which return EACCES in case the file is locked.
   * hatimerun: allowed hh:mm:ss notation for timeout values
   * halockrun: added the -N switch (no-op mode) as alternative 
                to -t.
   * improved error reporting in async mode (-a)
   * Special thanks go to Florian Helmberger for his efforts to
     test this release.

V2.00/18-Aug-2007:
   * More clearly defined the return values of hatimerun.
   * added -E option to halockrun so that a distinction between
     locking problems and other errors is possible.

V1.12/14-Aug-2006:
   * Fixed a bug which caused a compile time error on systems which
     need -lposix4 to have nanosleep() available (Thx to Stefan 
     Berglund for reporting and analyzing).
   * Fixed some warnings with -pedantic

V1.11/19-Jun-2006:
   * Fixed a bug in hatimerun which caused environment manipulation
     on some platforms. 
     The problem was observed, analyzed and reported by Thomas
     Picherot.

V1.10/27-May-2006:

   * Introduced the possibility to specify multiple -t -k and -e
     options to hatimerun. This allows sending more then one signal
     if the process doesn't terminate after the first one.

V1.00/15-Mar-2005:

   * Fixed a race-condition in hatimerun which could cause zombies
     until the timeout appears. Thx to Michael Polivanov for the report.


V0.99.09/7-Jan-2003:

   * Added the test mode for halockrun. Using the -t flag halockrun
     can check a file for a lock, if the file is locked (e.g. by
     another halockrun) the PID of the process holding the lock
     will be printed to stdout.
   * minor portability improvements

V0.99.08/26-Oct-2001:

   * Changed halockrun to not fork. This can be changed via the "-f" option.
   * Made signalhandling for halockrun and hatimerun to ignore TERM,
     HUP, INT, PIPE, QUIT, USR1 and USR2 in the parent.
   * Changed exitcode of hatimerun and halockrun if the child
     abnormally aborts.
   * hatimerun will always wait for the child to exit, even if the timeout
     occurs.
   * Fixed bug which caused hatimerun to not recognize "-k HUP" on non
     BSD systems.
 
   
V0.99.07/9-Aug-2001:

   * Applied patch from Scott Gallaher to fix some warnings.
   * Fixed getopt behavior on GNU systems (POSIXLY_CORRECT)
   * Fixed returncode of getopt (works on AIX now)
   * Improved Signallist creation procedure (works now for AIX and Solaris)
