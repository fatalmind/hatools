.SH DESCRIPTION
Executes the given
.I command
with the given
.I args
with a timeout of
.I secs
seconds.
If the new process doesn't terminate before a timeout 
exceeds
.B hatimerun
sends the process a signal.
.P
The
.I command
is run in its own process group, the termination signal is sent to this process group.
.P 
.I hatimerun
will always wait for the child to terminate, even if the timeout occurred but
the child didn't terminate on the signal.
.P
The 
.I hatimerun
process which waits for the child to exit ignores the following signals:
TERM, HUP, INT, PIPE, QUIT, USR1 and USR2.
.TP
.BI -t " [[hh:]mm:]secs"
Specifies the time the command has to finish before a signal will be sent. You can specify the timeout value in seconds or hours:minutes:seconds notation.
.br
Multiple occurrences of -t are supported. Every time a specified timeout happens a new signal is sent to the child. See EXAMPLES section for more info.
.TP
.BI -k " sig"
Specifies the signal witch will be sent to the process group if a timeout occurs. Multiple occurrences of -k are supported. In case multiple -t arguments are specified every time a new timeout happens the next specified signal will be sent. if there are less -k arguments then -t arguments specified the missing signals are defaulted to SIGKILL. See EXAMPLES section for more info.

Default:
.B "SIGKILL"\c

.TP
.BI -e " exitcode"
Changes the exitcode returned by
.B hatimerun
on timeout (if the program ends normally or abnormally after the first signal was sent) to
.I exitcode
Multiple occurrences of -e are supported in connection with multiple occurrences of -t.

Default: 
.B 99
.TP
.B -a
Starts 
.B hatimerun 
in the background. The hatimerun program exits immediately. The return code of the executed command is lost.
.TP
.B -l
Prints list of available symbolic signal names on this platform and exits.
.TP
.B -h | -?
Prints a help screen and exits.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
If the command terminates normally before the first timeout happened, 
On success
.B hatimerun
returns the return value of the given
.I command
.PP
After the first timeout happened
.B hatimerun
returns the value specified by the respective 
.I \-e
option or 
.B 99
per default. 
.B hatimerun
will always wait for the program to terminate, even if the program terminates normally after the first signal was sent, 
.B hatimerun
will return the respective error code as return value and the exit code of the command is lost.
.SH EXAMPLES
hatimerun \-t 5 sleep 10 
.RS 3
Will kill the sleep command after 5 seconds
.RE
.PP
hatimerun -k TERM -t 5 sleep 10
.RS 3
Will send the TERM signal after 5 seconds
.RE
.PP
hatimerun -k TERM -t 5 -e 100 -e 101 -t 1 sleep 10
.RS 3
Will send the TERM signal after 5 seconds, and (if the command didn't finish till then) send the KILL signal one second later (about 6 seconds after program start). Will return 100 if the program was terminated by the TERM signal or 101 if it was terminated by the KILL signal.
.RE
.PP
hatimerun -k HUP -t 1 nohup sleep 1000
.RS 3
Will send a HUP signal after one second and then wait (potentially forever) until the child terminates.
.RE
